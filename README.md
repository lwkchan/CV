## Laura Chan

I am a *Junior Full-Stack Developer*.

I graduated from university in 2016 and worked as a technology PR consultant for one year after that. Although I was a tech fan for a long, it was here that I was exposed to the business of technology. Not only that, as a PR I became adept at clear communication.

To find out more about my decision to go into coding, read my blogpost entitled (Why I changed tack in my career and started coding)[https://medium.com/@lwkchan/why-i-changed-tack-in-my-career-and-started-coding-ea6a8bcd0b4a].
