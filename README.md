I am a *Junior Full-Stack Developer*. My background combines a fascination for technology, strong communication skills and a hunger for learning.

After graduating from university in 2016, I worked as a technology PR consultant for one year. Although successful, a love for technology beyond the communication of it motivated me to change industries. *To find out more about my career move, read my blogpost entitled '[Why I changed tack in my career and started coding](https://medium.com/@lwkchan/why-i-changed-tack-in-my-career-and-started-coding-ea6a8bcd0b4a)'.*

I recently completed an intensive 12-week course on software engineering at Makers Academy. Here, I have grown from an amateur coder into a confident junior developer.

Now, I am looking for a job where I can contribute my enthusiasm for good technology. I would like a role which encourages me to work on my own initiative, challenges me with real, interesting problems and pushes me to learn more about full-stack development.
