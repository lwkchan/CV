# Laura Chan

:wave: Hello. I'm a software developer with six months' professional experience in front-end development. Besides software, I also have a background in PR and academic Philosophy. I love coding because I get to build meaningful tools, solve challenging problems and never stop learning!

:computer: Technologies: JavaScript (frameworks include React and Redux), Ruby (including Rails)

## Background
After graduating in 2016, I worked as a technology PR consultant. Although successful there, a fascination with technology and the idea of problem-solving motivated me to learn programming. (*To find out more, read my blogpost entitled '[Why I changed tack in my career and started coding](https://medium.com/@lwkchan/why-i-changed-tack-in-my-career-and-started-coding-ea6a8bcd0b4a)'.*) 

And so, in April 2018, I graduated from Makers Academy's 12-week course, and began working at the Telegraph. There, I was part of the team maintaining telegraph.co.uk and the new myTelegraph product, a personalised newsfeed for audiences built in React.

## Projects

| Project |Description| Technologies | Testing |
|---------|------------------|--------------|------|
|[Personal Blog](https://github.com/lwkchan/personal-blog)| Building a blog for myself to learn more about Gatsby and headless CMSes. See live on www.lwkchan.com| GatsbyJS, React, GraphQL, Contentful | N/A |
|[Tweep](https://github.com/lwkchan/twitter-on-cli)| A small Node app which allows you to use Twitter from the command line| NodeJS, Twitter API | Jest for unit tests; Cucumber and Aruba for feature tests|
| [Emu](https://github.com/MatthewBurstein/emu)| Weeks 11 and 12 final project at Makers Academy. We built a transpiler for a new language.|JavaScript|Jasmine|

## Skills

#### :computer: Clean coder
I was first introduced to OOP principles, such as SOLID and DRY, at Makers Academy. Since then, I have practised these both when creating new projects and working on legacy code. I make sure that naming and abstraction are always thought through.

#### :notebook: Learner
It's never about the end goal of mastering something. Rather, I am energised by the process of learning new skills and subjects. I enjoy challenging myself with new topics and new ways of learning - hence the varying university degrees of Classics and Philosophy, and now the move to Software Development.

#### :bulb: Problem-solver
I have enjoyed analysing logical systems for as long as I can remember. I was drawn to Classics as an undergraduate for the way the Latin language works; how its syntax and grammar fit together to generate meaning. While studying Philosophy, I fell in love with Logic. I was fascinated with how basic properties combined to create greater meaning. I was then drawn to coding for its problem-solving element, and how at first seemingly impossible problems can be solved through clean coding practices.

#### :speaker: Communication
PR and Philosophy have developed my personal habit for clear communication. In PR, I wrote content which clarified and explained complex technologies to stakeholders. As a developer, I enjoy talking about code written by myself or to others. I also enjoy the challenge of speaking to non-technical stakeholders about the software I build.

#### :speech_balloon: Stakeholder Management
As a PR executive, I worked with clients daily to ensure campaigns were delivered to a high standard. I collaborated with clients on campaigns and managed their expectations on what I could deliver. This has continued into my development career, where I try to be in constant dialogue with designers, analysts and product managers to make sure that we're aligned.
