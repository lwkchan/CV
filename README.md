# Laura Chan

I am a software developer at the Telegraph. Besides software, I also have a background in PR, media and academic Philosophy. I love coding because I get to build meaningful tools, solve challenging problems and never stop learning!

## Background
After graduating from university in 2016, I worked as a technology PR consultant. Although successful there, a deep fascination with technology and the idea of problem-solving motivated me to learn programming. (*To find out more, read my blogpost entitled '[Why I changed tack in my career and started coding](https://medium.com/@lwkchan/why-i-changed-tack-in-my-career-and-started-coding-ea6a8bcd0b4a)'.*) And so, I attended Makers Academy, a 12-week intensive course on software development, where I learned and practised principles of good software development.

## Projects

| Project |Description| Technologies | Testing |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Emu](https://github.com/MatthewBurstein/emu)| Weeks 11 and 12 final project at Makers Academy. We built a transpiler for a new language.|JavaScript|Jasmine|
| [Bombercat](https://github.com/lwkchan/bombercat)              | Week eight practice project at Makers Academy. This is a front-end JavaScript app which emulates the popular arcade game Bomberman.                                                                  | JavaScript, CreateJS, jQuery, HTML, CSS | Jasmine                      |

|[ Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/lwkchan/bowling-challenge)      | Fifth weekend challenge at Makers Academy This is a full-stack program which calculates the score of a bowling game.                                                                                 | JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS           | Jasmine                      |

## Skills

#### Clean coder
At Makers Academy, I learned and practised OOP principles, such as SOLID and DRY. I also practised Extreme Programming methodologies; this has influenced the way I work with other people and has nurtured my responsibility to test-drive the code I write (TDD/BDD). I would like to work at a company which values these principles as much as I do.

#### Learner
It's never about the end goal of mastering something. Rather, I am energised by the process of learning new skills and subjects. I enjoy challenging myself with new topics and new ways of learning - hence the varying university degrees of Classics and Philosophy, and now the move to Software Development.

#### Problem-solver
I have enjoyed analysing logical systems for as long as I can remember. I was drawn to Classics as an undergraduate for the way the Latin language works; how its syntax and grammar fit together to generate meaning. While studying Philosophy, I fell in love with Logic. I was fascinated with how basic properties combined to create greater meaning. I was then drawn to coding for its problem-solving element, and how at first seemingly impossible problems can be solved through clean coding practices.

#### Communication
PR and Philosophy have developed my personal habit for clear communication. In PR, I wrote press releases and bylines which clarified and explained complex technologies to the media, internal stakeholders and the public. As a Philosophy student, I became adept at breaking down and analysing the validity of arguments. As a developer, I enjoy teaching others about code and technology, whether that be explaining it to a non-techie or a fellow coder.

#### Stakeholder Management
As a PR executive, I worked with clients daily to ensure campaigns were delivered to a high standard. I collaborated with clients on campaigns and managed their expectations on what I could deliver. I have organised and carried out press launches and media outreach campaigns (i.e. sharing press releases, organising interviews and managing device review programs) throughout my PR career.
