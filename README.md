I am an aspiring *Junior Full-Stack Developer* with a background in PR, media and academic Philosophy.

## Background
After graduating university in 2016, I worked as a technology PR consultant. Although successful, a love for technology and the idea of problem-solving motivated me to learn programming. *To find out more, read my blogpost entitled '[Why I changed tack in my career and started coding](https://medium.com/@lwkchan/why-i-changed-tack-in-my-career-and-started-coding-ea6a8bcd0b4a)'.*

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, I am now looking for a job where I can contribute my enthusiasm for good technology and clean coding practices. I would like a role which encourages me to work on my own initiative, challenges me with meaningful problems and encourages continuous learning.

## Skills

#### Learner
It's never about the end goal of mastering something. Rather, I am energised by the process of learning new skills and subjects - hence the varying university degrees of Classics and Philosophy.

#### Problem-solver
I have enjoyed working with logic for as long as I can remember. While studying Philosophy, I fell in love with Logic, the language at the base of all languages. I was fascinated with how its basic properties combined to create greater meaning.

#### Communication
PR and Philosophy have developed a habit for clear communication. I enjoy the challenge of breaking down complex ideas into simple concepts and the process of teaching others. I [blog](https://medium.com/@lwkchan) as well.

#### Stakeholder Management
As a PR executive, I worked with clients daily to ensure campaigns were delivered to their high standards. I collaborated with clients on PR campaigns and managed their expectations on what we could deliver.
